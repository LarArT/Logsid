Brainwave entrainment, also known as neural entrainment or brainwave synchronization, is the process where the brain's electrical activity (brainwaves) naturally synchronizes to the rhythm of external sensory stimuli.

	- # Type
		- [[neuro modulation par ultrason]]
			- low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS)
		- [[Auditory]]: Sounds like pure tones, music, binaural beats, and isochronic tones.
		- [[Visual]]: Flickering lights.
		- Tactile: Vibrations.
		- [[Electromagnetic]]: Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF).
- The brain has a natural tendency to match its dominant brainwave frequency to the frequency of the external stimulus, a phenomenon known as the Frequency Following Response (FFR).
   		  Methods of Brainwave Entrainment:
   		   * Binaural Beats: This method involves listening to two different tones with slightly different frequencies through headphones, one in each ear. The brain perceives a third tone, the "binaural beat," which is the difference between the two frequencies. For example, if one ear hears a 400 Hz tone and the other hears a 410 Hz tone, the perceived binaural beat is 10 Hz (an alpha frequency). Headphones are essential for binaural beats to work effectively.
   		   * Isochronic Tones: These are single tones that turn on and off at regular, evenly spaced intervals, creating a rhythmic pulsing sound. Unlike binaural beats, isochronic tones do not require headphones to be effective as the pulsing rhythm is directly present in the sound itself.
   		   * Monaural Beats: Similar to binaural beats, monaural beats are created by combining two tones of slightly different frequencies, but the combination occurs before reaching the ears (e.g., through speakers or mixed into a single audio channel for headphones). The brain perceives the beat as an amplitude modulation in the single tone.
   		   * Photic (Light) Stimulation: This involves using flashing lights at specific frequencies, often through specialized goggles. The brain's visual cortex can synchronize its activity to these rhythmic light pulses.
   		   * Audio-Visual Entrainment (AVE): This method combines both auditory and visual stimuli, often using synchronized light and sound patterns to enhance the entrainment effect.
   		   * Music Modulation: Brainwave entrainment frequencies can be embedded within music or nature sounds to make the listening experience more pleasant.
   		   * Electromagnetic Stimulation (PEMF): Devices emitting pulsed electromagnetic fields at specific frequencies are used to influence brain activity.
   		   * Haptic Stimulation: Vibrational stimuli applied to the body at specific frequencies can also induce entrainment.
   		   * Neurofeedback: This is a type of biofeedback that directly monitors brainwave activity (usually via EEG) and provides real-time feedback to the individual, allowing them to learn to consciously control their brainwave patterns. While not a passive stimulation method, it aims for self-entrainment.
   		  Potential Benefits and Research:
   		  Research suggests that brainwave entrainment may have several potential benefits, including:
   		   * Relaxation and Stress Reduction: Lower frequencies (alpha and theta) are often used to promote calmness and reduce anxiety.
   		   * Improved Sleep: Delta frequencies are associated with deep sleep.
   		   * Enhanced Focus and Concentration: Beta and gamma frequencies are linked to alertness and cognitive processing.
   		   * Improved Mood: Some frequencies are associated with positive emotional states.
   		   * Increased Creativity: Alpha and theta states are often linked to enhanced creativity.
   		   * Pain Management: Some studies have explored the use of brainwave entrainment for pain relief.
   		   * Cognitive Enhancement: Certain frequencies may improve memory and learning.
   		  While research in this area is ongoing and some findings require further robust studies with larger sample sizes and controlled designs, the existing evidence suggests promising therapeutic potential for brainwave entrainment in various areas of mental health and well-being.
   		  Important Considerations:
   		   * Headphones: Are generally required for binaural beats to be effective.
   		   * Individual Differences: Responses to brainwave entrainment can vary between individuals.
   		   * Not a Replacement for Medical Treatment: Brainwave entrainment should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment for any health condition.
   		   * Safety: While generally considered safe, individuals with epilepsy or a history of seizures should exercise caution with visual stimulation. It's always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.
