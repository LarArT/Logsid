  thank you for listen I'd like to talk to
  you about concert framework which is a
  framework in Cocke prove assistant for
  the verification of smart contracts so
  first of all I'd like to tell you a bit
  about the the Khobar Center where this
  this work takes takes place so Cobra R
  stands for Concordia blockchain Research
  Center there is a big research center at
  Ava's University in Denmark which is
  sponsored by the Concordia nation so
  last year we organized TV BC in ohms and
  this was a a big success and now we're
  very happy to do that vanessa has taken
  the role too and to organizes in Spain
  unfortunately we could not do this in
  Spain but we're very happy with the
  collaboration with Vanessa in Spain and
  we're happy that so many people actually
  showed up virtually about a Concordia
  --m company the concordia company is
  developing a privacy centric public
  permissionless blockchain built for
  businesses and there's a strong emphasis
  on science and software quality so
  there's a lot of collaboration between
  the university and the company and we
  have weekly lunch meetings together and
  a lot of communication going on between
  us so I'd like to to put up there
  pictures of technological so the newness
  had postdoc in my group in the
  occupation a PhD student in my group and
  they've been very important in the
  development of this cosmic framework
  there are two publications connected to
  this work so what's the problem I'd like
  to talk about so smart contracts they
  operate in a unique adversarial
  environment their contracts guard
  millions of euros behind a few lines of
  code a lot of people know about the the
  dial the this is basically a distributed
  filling agency that due to a small book
  or someone would say a feature in the in
  the contract
  someone took out about million euros
  recently we had a very similar attack on
  distributed exchange called de force and
  as you can see at the picture here on my
  screen
  they lost million euros in a very
  short time and this was again a very
  similar attack to the one of the Dow
  what what is what is very striking on
  the blockchain as you probably know is
  that officer department is very hard or
  impossible to change so this is a code
  is law now we want to model these smart
  contracts that that's quite difficult
  because smart contracts they they
  interact in very complex ways so it's
  not enough just to reason about the
  contracts in isolation for example if
  you consider a crowdfunding contract
  this can always try to pay back to
  funders so we really need to be careful
  when reasoning about these block chains
  and that's why that's what makes it so
  hard also to do it informally so it's
  it's not that these people were were
  particularly read um it's just it's a
  very hard problem to do this right
  so now fortunately we have a long long
  tradition in mathematics and some are
  shorter in improving software to be
  correct so if you want to reason about
  imperative programs that's difficult but
  reasoning about functional programs it's
  much easier because functional programs
  are just mathematical functions I'm
  lying a little bit here but people that
  know what I'm talking about will know
  what I mean what's happening in these in
  these computer proof assistance is it's
  it's it's an interaction a game if you
  want between the human and the computer
  so the the human construct construct a
  proof and a computer checks it and the
  computer will tell you well I can now
  progress to prove a little bit but I
  still need some help in figuring out
  this aspect so it's really a dialogue
  between you and the computer
  and the computer is really helpful to
  make sure that all the details are
  actually checked we're using and lots of
  people with us the probe assistant
  which is a foundational probe assistant
  which means that it reduces proof all
  the way to the actions of mathematics so
  if you have checked your your proof in
  this prove assistant you can be very
  sure that the probe is actually correct
  and you haven't missed any cases of
  course we're not the first one to
  suggest this and quite a few people in
  the formal methods community have looked
  at reasoning about smart contracts
  however the modeling something like the
  Dow in a foundational way is still very
  hard and we're the first to actually do
  this so most of the the previous work
  this has focused on on local functional
  correctness these restraints is done by
  deductive verifies and static analysis
  that's already very useful of course
  because if there's if you if you make a
  mistake in your addition or
  multiplication you can see that you can
  also lose a lot of money and this may
  seem trivial but I mean you could have
  under flows or overflow so it's very
  important also to have this local
  functional correctness some models are
  limited to some some tools only
  organizations only model very limited
  parts of the surrounding environment
  there's the the key work on simplicity
  was one of the first works on verifying
  smart contracts inside the cup reverse
  instant and the sila also contributed a
  lot and michaud of the diminution
  language of their tations company so
  they're not really in reasoning about
  the interaction of contracts now
  fortunately the cocoa assistant allows
  us to model all of mathematics so it has
  a sufficiently advanced language for the
  concrete contracts the
  execution layer and we can we can use
  all of mathematics to reason about it so
  if we can prove something about these
  contracts on paper or the first thing is
  we would have an informal argument that
  it's correct then we could try to make a
  mathematical proof but we could actually
  completely capture this mathematical
  proof in our probe assistant so we can
  do all of this in the prophecies and
  moreover the proof assistant has a built
  in functional language recall that what
  I said in the beginning a function of a
  computer program in a functional
  language is just a mathematical function
  so we can reason about them as functions
  and did all of this is captured very
  nicely in the and a core group system so
  what is the execution layer so as you
  can see in the example here we have a
  user a that calls a contract X and then
  the contract X sends a message or some
  money to use a B to use a D and it calls
  a new context Y and Y again sends a
  message to user see now we have this
  whole tree and then the question is how
  do we actually handle these calls these
  messages they're at least two ways to do
  this and both are actually reasonable
  the theorem is using the depth-first
  search so actually you can see that the
  message from contact Y to users he has
  done first before message whereas in
  the breadth first test which is used in
  integers and silica disclosing the other
  way around you can do the red and the
  blue parts the ones are different so the
  execution layer takes care of the state
  updates and an important also about the
  ordering of messages so traditional
  being very important for reasoning now
  we model the execution layer so that
  there as I said so they're multiple
  reasonable ways to schedule these calls
  and some properties may holds
  one order and not in the other one
  example is the the de force attack this
  is much more difficult in in one order
  than in the other
  but what we do in our in our work is we
  leave the execution layer completely
  general and then we can later
  instantiate it if we want to reason
  about things that are particular for one
  one execution layer so we have no
  restrictions on the order and the other
  details are also inspired so in this way
  we can capture a number of a number of
  execution layers and including the one
  of the concordia company as well as the
  ones that i mentioned before
  so this is just to give you an idea of
  how we actually model the model de to
  contracts and here you can see that if
  you're used to programming in an in a
  functional language then this is
  something you'd be cards familiar with
  so a contract has to has two functions
  in it and receive and you can see that
  so in it takes a chain a contract call
  context and then returns a may return
  estate and similarly for the receive
  function I just mostly wanted to give
  you this as an illustration to see how
  how it's actually modeled so the chain
  takes information about the the world
  about the contract that the contracts
  view of the world and the contract
  called call context contains all the
  information about the call so this help
  this give you some idea of how we do our
  modeling what is important is that the
  the contracts actually interact
  explicitly with the execution layer so
  the the calls that the transfers and the
  deployments are all communicated
  explicitly as a data type the the action
  body you can see at the end of the
  receive function
  implementations they must exceed
  exhibited at race that ends in the
  current state and we give as I said we
  give to two implementations and depth
  first and embed first implementation and
  both of these actually the nice thing is
  this head so functions in Koch are
  computer programs so these two
  implementations we can actually run
  inside to prove assistant and this will
  also help us to actually do the proofs
  and also to to play with the proof so
  I'll say a bit more at the end we can
  also do a property based testing about
  these proofs so the DAO contract is
  somewhat longer and it contains a number
  of things that are not so relevant for
  the actual tech and so we choose to to
  take a basically the core of the of the
  DAO this is called the the congress and
  this is a standard educational contract
  on the on the etherium blockchain and we
  implemented this inside the the
  functional language inside the Koch
  system so so what it does it allows
  members to vote on on proposals and then
  this proposal contain a number of
  actions and there's there's a complex
  dynamic a complex and dynamic
  interaction between them because yeah
  once once it's a proposals carried out
  it can can make a colon and one of the
  calls it could one of reactions it could
  do is call back to the original contract
  and this is precisely what happens with
  the good Erie entrance key back in the
  year in a doubt the Italo tech about
  this Congress is fairly short it's only
  lines of code so that's that's nice
  because that makes it very manageable
  now what is the the contract Congress as
  you can see it again I give you some
  some illustration of how this actually
  looks
  the in the probe assistant so what what
  what kind of messages can be sent well
  we can transfer ownership we can change
  the rules we can add a member we can
  remove a member create a proposal vote
  for a proposal vote against a proposal
  retract a proposal finish a proposal so
  this is just to give you an illustration
  of what what the Congress actually looks
  like but you would imagine that if you
  if you think about what what an actual
  Congress does it passes new new laws and
  it makes proposals for for new laws and
  then made its this is a way of
  simulating what a Congress does on the
  blockchain now what what many of these
  formal methods tools dead depths came up
  as a as a as a reaction to the Dow the
  Dow heck did they so so quick analysis
  after the Dow heck was that we entrance
  he was a problem and this is something
  that one can test statically so that
  there quite a few static analysis tools
  that allow you to look for the entrance
  epromise that the the Congress
  actually needs free entrance ereally
  work and also another thing of course is
  once you know that a certain problem
  exists it's easy to look for it so what
  we our starting point was was different
  what we tried to do was to write the
  contract then write a reasonable
  specification for it and see whether we
  would find the de Burgh in this way so
  we did a partial specification we
  developed a list of ten different
  properties just to get to stay to be the
  behavior we wanted up to control of the
  Congress
  and one of the things that one comes up
  with is that the and and this is
  something that one of the UH cops
  incites the number of transactions that
  are sent out is less than the number of
  incisions that creates proposal message
  so this is something that you want to
  prove is an invariant and once you start
  proving this you see that this this is
  not provable and this also shows you
  where the where the possible attack is
  moreover this so we made both a
  venerable Congress that still has the
  book in a safe Congress that is that
  actually has has this wanted property
  respect back for black box specification
  and moreover we prove that this not only
  holds for the year the dead first search
  from criteria but also for for any other
  execution layer I mean any other
  execution layer that fits our
  specification so it's actually more
  general than just going to be theory on
  blockchain so this is a conclusion of
  the first part of the talk so we give a
  formalization of execution layers in
  Cocke and it's very important to
  emphasize that contracts don't live in
  isolation we prove that the the Congress
  is safe against aus teletext
  and we do this by proving natural
  properties of the code of the Congress
  so it's a and yeah we proved it we do
  this by proving natural properties about
  Commerce so now there are a number of
  questions that come up one thing that
  that was important in the original of
  attack was the amount of gas or energy
  that's that's needed so reasoning about
  resources reasoning about resources is
  is harder yet so all addresses oh I'll
  show how our framework actually handles
  this
  could potentially handle this musing
  about resources so I'll show how we
  address that problem I will plan to
  address a problem so now we have we have
  some functional language in in the
  crew persistent but now we want to be
  sure that this actually corresponds to
  the smart contract that's actually
  running on chain so there's a question
  on how we do this and we'll make a
  connection to the concordia m-- middling
  language which is very close to l the
  the own functional language another big
  question is we made these verified
  execution layers and again how does this
  correspond to things on chain there
  isn't an extraction functionality inside
  the cockroach system that would
  potentially allow us to Det that allows
  us to translate programs in the
  groove assistance to both Haskell and oh
  camel so we could potentially win this
  execution layer on top of the actual
  implementation our modeling of course
  doesn't use the most advanced data types
  so it's only a mathematical model of the
  actual code
  so one thing we would like to do in the
  future is actually optimize this
  execution like it could be much more
  efficient and then we could potentially
  extract this to to live running code so
  as I said
  we cannot currently reason about about
  resources to be able to do this to
  reason about a meter theory we want to
  use what is called a deep embedding in
  the prove assistant people that are
  familiar with the field will know the
  difference about the difference between
  deep and shallow embeddings for a
  non-experts you could think about
  Madrid's famous piping Phaedrus famous
  painting Cecina upon people and the
  message of the painting is followed this
  is not actually a pipe it's a picture of
  a pipe we have something very similar in
  logic so in this yellow embedding the
  functions in our smart contract language
  are modeled as mathematical functions
  but that means we cannot reason about
  the code or the function so did what
  happening happening in the deep
  embedding is that one actually has the
  code of the program in hand and this is
  very convenient for the meter theory and
  if you have the code of the program in
  hand you can also reason about the
  execution of the year of the function
  and and for example bounded by the
  amount of guests that sent to that
  particular function we have not done
  that last part but we now have the
  possibility to actually do so what is is
  new and this technique so usually one
  chooses either the deep embedding or the
  shallow embedding for one particular
  problem what we've done here is to make
  a very tight combination between the
  differential and values now the question
  is what is the the smart contract
  language we're actually reasoning about
  and what we've done here is to abstract
  from a number of functional smart
  conflict languages and we have taken
  what we call lambda smart which is an
  explicitly attacked system F with
  abstract data types in structural
  recursion this is more or less the the
  core language of the Koch odium
  blockchain which is called rattling or
  it's a pure subset
  of nml like functional language so this
  is really a very standard very standard
  language and this can also be translated
  to for instance that pesos or the year
  the patient's under Jun blockchains so
  before I come to how we combine the deep
  and shallow embedding let me tell you a
  little bit about the the meter
  product project so but of course what
  we'd like is by using this proved
  assistant to know that things are
  absolutely correct
  now is about years old and
  occasionally one finds a logical
  correctness book and these are extremely
  subtle and it's actually very unlikely
  that these are actually used in if you
  actually introduce your proof but still
  people want the the developers want
  to have an even higher quality of area
  of their tool and this is why they're
  developing their the meet up project so
  we prove correct in itself and if
  you if you have a logical background
  then you can see that there's a girdle
  problem coming up here this can actually
  be be circumvented in is in this case
  but it's a completely different story
  but in particular there's a
  formalization of Cox evaluation and and
  this is very convenient because that's
  now what we're going to to compare with
  so we have our evaluation of the smart
  contract language and we come to proof
  inside the system that the
  evaluation is precisely the same thing
  as the evaluation of so then we're
  absolutely certain that the the two
  models are the same one other thing that
  meteor project allows us is to have
  certified compilers and one nice
  consequence of this is when one writes
  an interpreter inside the
  inside this framework one can easily
  automatically get a compiler out of this
  so this is also something that we we
  expect to get some islets out because
  once we have defined an interpreter we
  can actually run it very efficiently
  inside this framework so here's the big
  picture what what we do is we start from
  the from the left we have our ast from
  our smart contract language our abstract
  syntax tree then we basically copy this
  by by a scripts one to one into the deep
  embedding so then we have an encoding of
  this ast inside the system then we
  translate it but there are a number of
  transformations that are needed in this
  translation so we translate well it does
  is it takes system f+ inductors and it
  translates it into the Demeter theory of
  coke which as I said is very close but
  there's still quite a few non-trivial
  transformations that need to be made and
  what we do and that's the square on the
  left this is check to be absolutely
  correct so we have a soundness theorem
  if the smart smart contracting smarts
  contract actually terminates then the
  outcome guarantees with is certified
  evaluation income so there's a very high
  level of guarantee that that everything
  is completely correct but then we want
  to go further because then we have this
  functional program or the the encoding
  of this functional program inside the
  inside the coq system and we also want
  to run these things and in particular we
  want to hook it up with the the
  execution framework that I here I showed
  you in the first part of the talk so
  then we connect it basically by
  interpreting this code into a functional
  language into this yellow embedding so
  then we get regular croc programs and we
  in at this level we can also already
  very conveniently prove functional
  correctness properties but moreover we
  have connected LptA
  Christian framework so we can now reason
  about very complex smart contracts like
  the custom coins uni swap the Dow all
  these
